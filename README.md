# nvim-config

My nvim-config based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/joelazar/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```

At first run, Neovim will install all necessary plugins, LSPs, formatters and dap adapters.

And you are done! ðŸŽ‰
